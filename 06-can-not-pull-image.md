## Issue 6: Cannot Pull Image
> Symptoms: A pod is in an ImagePullBackOff or ErrImagePull state.


A pod in an ImagePullBackOff or ErrImagePull state means that Kubernetes cannot pull the container image for the pod. This can happen for a number of reasons, including:

* The image does not exist in the container registry.
* The image is not accessible from the Kubernetes node.
* There is a problem with the network between the Kubernetes node and the container registry.
* There is a problem with the Kubernetes configuration.

To troubleshoot a pod in an ImagePullBackOff or ErrImagePull state, you can use the following steps:

Run the following command to get more information about the pod:<br />
`kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`<br />
Look for any events in the output that indicate why the image cannot be pulled. For example, if the image does not exist in the container registry, you will see an event like the following:<br />
FailedPull 1m ago  kubelet, pod-name  Failed to pull image <br />"nginx:latest": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon: pull access denied for "nginx:latest", repository does not exist or you don't have access

Once you have identified the reason why the image cannot be pulled, you can take steps to fix the issue. For example, if the image does not exist in the container registry, you can create the image or use a different image.<br />
Here are some specific troubleshooting tips:

Make sure that the image exists in the container registry.<br />
Make sure that the Kubernetes node has access to the container registry. You can check this by running the following command:<br />
`kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- ping <container-registry-hostname>`<br />
If the command fails, there is a problem with the network between the Kubernetes node and the container registry.

Make sure that the Kubernetes configuration is correct. You can check this by running the following command:<br />
`kubectl get configmap -n kube-system kube-proxy -o jsonpath='{.data.config}'`<br />
The output of this command should contain the following section:

    bindAddress: 0.0.0.0
    clusterCIDR: 10.244.0.0/16
    healthzBindAddress: 0.0.0.0:10256
    hostnameOverride: ""
    kubeconfigPath: /var/lib/kube-proxy/kubeconfig
    masqueradeAll: true
    mode: "iptables"
    portRange: ""
    proxyMode: "iptables"
If any of these values are incorrect, you can update the configmap and restart the kube-proxy service.
