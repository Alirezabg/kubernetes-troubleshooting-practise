Issue 9: Persistent Volume (PV) Not Bound
Symptoms: A pod that requires persistent storage is in Pending state, and its associated Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is in Pending state as well.

There are a few reasons why a Persistent Volume (PV) might not be bound:

The PVC has incompatible access modes with the PV.
The PVC has incompatible resource requests with the PV.
The PV and PVC are in different namespaces.
The PV and PVC have different labels.
There are no PVs that match the PVC's requirements.
To troubleshoot a PV that is not bound, you can use the following steps:

Verify that the PVC has compatible access modes with the PV. The PVC's access mode must be one or more of the PV's access modes. You can check the PVC's access mode by running the following command:
kubectl get pvc <pvc-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.accessModes}'
You can check the PV's access modes by running the following command:

kubectl get pv <pv-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.accessModes}'
Verify that the PVC has compatible resource requests with the PV. The PVC's resource requests must be less than or equal to the PV's capacity. You can check the PVC's resource requests by running the following command:
kubectl get pvc <pvc-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.resources.requests}'
You can check the PV's capacity by running the following command:

kubectl get pv <pv-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.capacity}'
Verify that the PV and PVC are in the same namespace. The PV and PVC must be in the same namespace in order for them to be bound. You can check the PVC's namespace by running the following command:
kubectl get pvc <pvc-name> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.namespace}'
You can check the PV's namespace by running the following command:

kubectl get pv <pv-name> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.namespace}'
Verify that the PV and PVC have compatible labels. The PV and PVC must have at least one label in common in order for them to be bound. You can check the PVC's labels by running the following command:
kubectl get pvc <pvc-name> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}'
You can check the PV's labels by running the following command:

kubectl get pv <pv-name> -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels}'
Verify that there are PVs that match the PVC's requirements. If there are no PVs that match the PVC's requirements, the PVC will not be able to bind to a PV. You can check the list of PVs by running the following command:
kubectl get pv
If you are still having trouble troubleshooting a PV that is not bound, you can consult the Kubernetes documentation or ask for help on the Kubernetes community forums.

Here are some additional troubleshooting tips:

Try restarting the kube-scheduler service.
Try deleting the PVC and recreating it.
Try upgrading to the latest version of Kubernetes.
