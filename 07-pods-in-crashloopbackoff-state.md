## Issue 7: Pods in CrashLoopBackOff State
> Symptoms: After deploying a new application or updating an existing one, the pod consistently restarts and is in a CrashLoopBackOff state.


Pods in a CrashLoopBackOff state means that Kubernetes is continuously trying to restart the pods, but the pods are failing to start successfully. This can happen for a number of reasons, including:

The application is crashing for some reason.
The application is not compatible with the Kubernetes environment.
There is a problem with the Kubernetes configuration.
To troubleshoot pods in a CrashLoopBackOff state, you can use the following steps:

Run the following command to get more information about the pods:
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
Look for any events in the output that indicate why the pods are crashing. For example, if the application is crashing, you will see an event like the following:
CrashLoopBackOff 4m ago  kubelet, pod-name  Container "my-app" failed: Exit 137

Once you have identified the reason why the pods are crashing, you can take steps to fix the issue. For example, if the application is crashing, you need to fix the bug in the application.
Here are some specific troubleshooting tips:

Check the pod logs to see if there are any errors or warnings. You can get the pod logs by running the following command:
kubectl logs <pod-name>
If the application is crashing, try to reproduce the crash locally. Once you have reproduced the crash, you can start debugging the application.
If the application is not compatible with the Kubernetes environment, you will need to make changes to the application to make it compatible with Kubernetes. For example, you may need to change the application's port assignments or add additional environment variables.
If there is a problem with the Kubernetes configuration, you will need to fix the problem with the Kubernetes configuration.
If you are still having trouble troubleshooting pods in a CrashLoopBackOff state, you can consult the Kubernetes documentation or ask for help on the Kubernetes community forums.

Here are some additional troubleshooting tips:

Make sure that the pods have enough resources (CPU, memory, etc.) to run successfully.
Make sure that the pods are not running into any resource conflicts (e.g., two pods trying to bind to the same port).
Make sure that the pods have access to the necessary resources (e.g., databases, filesystems, etc.).
Make sure that the Kubernetes nodes are healthy and have enough resources to run the pods.
If you are still having trouble troubleshooting pods in a CrashLoopBackOff state, you can try the following:

Restart the Kubernetes API server and controller manager.
Delete the pods and try deploying them again.
Upgrade to the latest version of Kubernetes.
